## Checks

### Unrankables (Problems)

|:---------:|:---------------------------:|
| Compose   | Long note too short (<20ms) |
| Resources | Missing hitnormal           |
| ~~Timing~~    | ~~Unnormalized SVs in EZ/NM~~   |

### Minor/Unreliable checks (Warnings)

| Category |                Check               |
|:--------:|:----------------------------------:|
| Compose  | Long note too short (<30ms)        |
| Settings | Too high OD                        |

| Files    | Hitsound difficulty in song folder |
| Spread   | Chord size too high                |


## Planned Checks

- ~~Check that Easy difficulty doesn't have scroll changes~~
- Check whether variable timing maps have scroll Normalisation
- Check whether normalizing Green Lines are right on top of Red Lines
- Complete hitsound checks (consistency between difficulties, duplicate hitsounds, etc.)
- Check for **extremely** close together notes to avoid stuff like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/808360583669874688/996761548536156281/unknown.png).
